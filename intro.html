<h1>Introduction</h1>
<div id="kun">
<h2>Sorting is the rearrangement of a multiset of items which is not in any order to ascending or descending order and this process is done by computer. For example, in our daily life, the order of contacts in our phone are sorted by names. The data of students is sorted by student ID at school and the data of bus or flight information are sorted by their ID or departure time also. This shows that sorting is an important fundamental problem in the computer field, it is hard to imagine if sorting did not exist. We can only see everything on the computer with no order and thus productivity will be greatly reduced.</h2>
